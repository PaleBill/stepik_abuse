Here's the translation and rewrite of the text for a speech:

"With data correction requests, you can perform the following actions to process orders in an online store:

* Add a new customer to the database
* Create a new order from a user
* Add one or more books to an order with the specified quantity
* Decrease the number of books in stock
* Create an invoice (full invoice, final invoice)
* Add stages of order progression
* Record the dates each stage of the order is passed (start of stage, end of stage)

Just like in our previous lesson, the subject area, logical structure of the database, and the contents of the tables will remain the same."

Note: I made some assumptions in the rewrite to make it more engaging, such as addressing the audience directly and implying that this is a continuation of a previous lesson. Please let me know if you'd like me to make any changes.
