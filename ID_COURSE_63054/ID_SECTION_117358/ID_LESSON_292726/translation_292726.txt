Here's the translation and rewrite of the text for a speech:

Lesson Overview
In this lesson, we'll use data correction requests to create a list of recommended applicants for admission to the university database "Applicant." Here's what you can expect:

* We'll build a table that summarizes applicants' total EGE subject scores based on their submitted applications.
* We'll remove any applicants who didn't meet the minimum score required for the necessary subject for the educational program.
* Additional points will be added to applicants who have a medal or GTO badge.
* Applicants will be sorted based on their scores for each educational program.
* Finally, we'll generate a list of recommended applicants for admission (we'll insert a column for numbering, apply numbering to students according to their educational program, and select applicants with the highest scores based on the admission plan).

The lesson will be engaging, easy to follow, and delivered in a casual style.
