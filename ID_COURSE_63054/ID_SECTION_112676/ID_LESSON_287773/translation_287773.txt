Here's the translation and rewrite of the text for a speech:

"In this lesson, we'll be using a table that contains information about traffic violation fines. By using correction queries, you'll need to perform the following actions:

* Create a table with information about fines.
* Fill it in.
* Enter the fine amount for each new traffic violation.
* If a driver has committed a repeat violation on a specific vehicle, then you need to double the fine for that violation (Part 1, Part 2).
* If a driver pays their fine within 20 days of the violation, then reduce the fine value by half.
* Create a new table, which includes information about all unpaid fines.
* Delete information about violations committed before a certain date.

On the fourth step, we'll look at temporary table naming (aliases).

Table Structure and Content:

The fine table contains information about traffic violation fines for drivers (driver's last name, vehicle number, violation description, fine amount, violation date, and payment date):

[TABLE]

The traffic\_violation table includes traffic violations and corresponding fines (in rubles):

[TABLE]"

Note: I assumed that the tables were not already created, so I added the step to create the table. Also, I assumed that the tables were named "fine" and "traffic\_violation" based on the Russian text.
