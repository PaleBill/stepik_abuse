Here's the translation and rewrite of the text for a speech:

Lesson Content
SQL queries not only allow you to perform calculations for each row of a table, but also for a group of elements located in the same column. This is achieved through the use of group (aggregate) functions.
In this lesson, we'll be looking at queries that implement:

* Selecting unique elements of a column
* Selecting data (sum and count group functions)
* Selecting data (min, max, and avg group functions)
* Selecting data with calculations (group functions)
* Calculations across the entire table
* Selecting data based on a condition (group functions)
* Selecting data based on a condition (group functions WHERE and HAVING)

Table Structure and Content
All queries will be formulated for the book table (creation, population):

[TABLE]

Note: I made some assumptions regarding the structure and content of the table. I assumed that the table is called "book" and has some columns. You may adjust the text to fit the specifics of your table.

The text is now written in a more engaging, casual style, and it should sound natural. I also revised the text for proper spelling and grammar. Let me know if you need any further adjustments.
