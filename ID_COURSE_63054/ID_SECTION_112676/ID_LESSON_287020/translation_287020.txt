Here's the translation and rewrite of the text for a speech:

Lesson Content:
SQL not only allows you to retrieve data from database tables but also modify information in them. This is done using data modification queries, which let you:

* Create an empty table
* Add records to a table as a set of values
* Add records from another table
* Add records from another table using a subquery
* Change values in a single column
* Change values in multiple columns
* Change data using multiple tables
* Delete records from a table
* Create a table based on data from other tables

On this lesson, we'll be looking at queries for implementing common warehouse actions such as:

* Adding a new product (adding, updating, deleting data)
* Selling a product (updating data)
* Creating a new order (creating a table)

Table Structure and Population:
The table that will be used in the queries is called "book" (creation, population):

[TABLE]
| id | name | author | price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Book 1 | Author 1 | 100 |
| 2 | Book 2 | Author 2 | 200 |
| 3 | Book 3 | Author 3 | 300 |

Alright, let's dive in and learn how to use SQL data modification queries to manage our warehouse operations!
