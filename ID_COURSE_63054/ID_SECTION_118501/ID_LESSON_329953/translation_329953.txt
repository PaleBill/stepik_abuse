Task Assignment:
Author: Dmitry Kravtsov

The store has decided that classics are no longer popular, so here's what we need to do to the selection:

1. Change all authors to "Daria Donczova".
2. Add "Evlampia Románova and " at the beginning of each book title (with a space at the end).
3. Increase the price by 42% (round it to two decimal places).
4. Sort by decreasing price.

Speech Text:
Hey there, folks! Our store has decided to mix things up a bit with our book selection. We figured that the classics just ain't selling like they used to, so we've made some changes.

First off, we've replaced all the authors with the one and only Daria Donczova. Yep, you heard that right! But don't worry, we didn't stop there.

We've also added "Evlampia Románova and " to the beginning of every single book title. It's like a new series, but with a classic twist!

And, to spice things up even more, we've increased the price of every book by 42%. Don't worry, we've rounded it to two decimal places to make it look all nice and neat.

But wait, there's more! We've sorted the books by decreasing price, so you can see the most expensive ones first. It's like shopping for designer clothes, but for your brain!

So, come on down to our store and check out our new and improved book selection. You won't be disappointed!
