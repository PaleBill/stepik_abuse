Here's the translation and rewrite of the text for a speech:

"User-generated tasks. Be sure to let us know in the comments which requests you like! Points will not be awarded for these requests as they are optional for earning a certificate for the course."

"We've got some fun, user-generated tasks for you to try! Don't forget to let us know in the comments which ones you enjoyed. These tasks won't earn you any points towards your course certificate, but they're a great way to practice your skills in a more casual setting. So, give them a shot and have some fun!"
